# vim-plan9

A colourscheme for vim thatâ€™s basically 
[acme-colors](https://github.com/plan9-for-vimspace/acme-colors) 
with a bunch of customisations. This colourscheme uses the 
excellent [colortemplate]() by [lifepillar].

This colourscheme will work perfectly (meaning the colours are 
exactly what they are meant to be) in GUIs and 16 colour terminals 
using the included palette and terminfo. It *will* work in 256 
colour terminals, but not without a large degration in colour 
accuracy.
